```{r example}
library(cram)

base_folder       = "~/Downloads/runs"

## basic example code
(models = parse_directory(base_folder))

cram1 <- process_cram(
  base_year         = models$base_year[1],
  model_version     = models$model_version[1],
  base_folder       = models$base_folder[1],
)

head(cram1)
```

```{r}
plot(cram1$start_date, cram1$inflow_10_flow, type = 'l')
```
