The goal of cram is to process output from the Lynker CRAM model.


## Installation

You can install the development version of cram from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Lynker-Tech/cram")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(cram)

base_folder       = "D:/downloads/runs"

## basic example code
(models = parse_directory(base_folder))

cram1 <- process_cram(
            model_directory = models[5, ],
            return_wide     = TRUE
          )

head(cram1)
```

We can identify the variables in one of processed CRAM output sheets
```{r}
output_variables <- find_variables(
                        df   = cram1
                      )

head(output_variables, 15)
```

Identify available variables using `find_variables()`, and use `plot_cram()` to plot a set of variables for multiple model scenarios after processing CRAM output sheets using `process_cram() `
```{r}
# Plot specific variables for CRAM model runs
cram_plot <- plot_cram(
                  cram_df   = cram1,
                  plot_vars = output_variables$names[12:15],
                  start     = "2002-01-01",
                  end       = "2007-01-01",
                  wrap      = FALSE
                )

cram_plot
```
